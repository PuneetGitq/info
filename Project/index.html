      Our College is a unique educational institution of North India and holds a pre-eminent position in the glorious past of this region. In 1916 the institution was set up in Lahore, under the dynamic leadership of <b><i>Bharat Ratna Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya Ji</i>,</b> the backbone of Sanatan Dharma. After the partition of the country, the college was re-established in Ambala and the foundation stone of the building was laid by none other than India's first<b><i> President Dr. Rajender Prasad</i> on <u> 3 October 1951.</u></b>
